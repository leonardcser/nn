A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications
using React Router.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

## Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is
production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```

## Styling
